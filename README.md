# **Reactronic** - Transactionally-Reactive State Management

Reactronic is a JavaScript library that provides
[transactionally-reactive](https://blog.nezaboodka.com/post/2019/593-modern-database-should-natively-support-transactionally-reactive-programming)
state management in a Web application.

Transactional reactivity means that state changes are being made in an
isolated data snapshot and then, once atomically applied, are
**consistently propagated** to corresponding visual components for
(re)rendering. All that is done in automatic, seamless, and fine-grained
way, because reactronic **takes full care of tracking dependencies**
between visual components (observers) and state (observable objects).

Transactional reactivity is based on four fundamental concepts:

  - **Observable Objects** - a set of objects that store data of an
    application (state);
  - **Transaction** - a function that makes changes in observable
    objects in transactional (atomic) way;
  - **Reaction** - a function that is executed automatically in
    response to changes made by a transaction;
  - **Cache** - a computed value having associated function that is
    executed on-demand to renew the value if it becomes obsolete.

Demo application built with Reactronic: https://nevod.io/#/playground.
Source code of the demo: https://gitlab.com/nezaboodka/nevod.web.public/-/blob/master/README.md.

Quick introduction and detailed description is below.

## Quick Introduction

Here is an example of transactionally-reactive code with an observable
object, transaction and reaction:

``` typescript
class Demo extends ObservableObject {
  name: string = 'Nezaboodka Software'
  email: string = 'contact@nezaboodka.com'

  @transaction
  saveContact(name: string, email: string): void {
    this.name = name
    this.email = email
  }

  @reaction
  printContact(): void {
    // depends on `name` and `email` and reacts to their changes
    if (this.email.indexOf('@') >= 0)
      throw new Error(`wrong email ${this.email}`)
    console.log(this.name + ' <' + this.email + '>')
  }
}
```

In the example above, `printContact` reaction depends on `name`
and `email` fields. It is executed automatically in response
to changes of these fields made by `saveContact` transaction.

Here is an example of if cached value computed on-demand:

``` typescript
class Demo extends ObservableObject {
  name: string = 'Nezaboodka Software'
  email: string = 'contact@nezaboodka.com'

  @cached
  get contact(): string {
    return this.name + ' <' + this.email + '>'
  }

  @reaction
  printContact(): void {
    if (this.contact !== '')
      Console.log(this.contact)
  }
}
```

In the example above, the value of `contact` is computed from
source fields `name` and `email`. Once computed, the result is
cached and is reused until source fields `name` and `email` are
changed. Once source fields changed, `contact` value becomes
invalidated, thus causing execution of depending reaction
`printContact`. Then `printContact` reaction causes `contact`
re-computation on the first use.

## Observable Objects

Observable objects store data of an application. All such objects
are transparently hooked to track access to their properties,
both on reads and writes.

``` typescript
class MyModel extends ObservableObject {
  url: string = "https://github.com/nezaboodka/reactronic"
  content: string = "transactionally-reactive state management"
  timestamp: Date = Date.now()
}
```

In the example above, the class `MyModel` is based on Reactronic's
`ObservableObject` class and all its properties `url`, `content`,
and `timestamp` are hooked.

## Transaction

Transaction is a function that makes changes in observable objects
in transactional (atomic) way. Such a function is instrumented with hooks
to provide transparent atomicity (by implicit context switching
and isolation).

``` typescript
class MyModel extends ObservableObject {
  // ...
  @transaction
  async load(url: string): Promise<void> {
    this.url = url
    this.content = await fetch(url)
    this.timestamp = Date.now()
  }
}
```

In the example above, the transactional function `load` makes
changes to `url`, `content` and `timestamp` properties. While
transaction is running, the changes are visible only inside the
transaction itself. The new values become atomically visible outside
of the transaction only upon its completion.

Atomicity is achieved by making changes in an isolated data
snapshot that is not visible outside of the running transaction
until it is fully finished and applied. Multiple objects
and their properties can be changed with full respect
to the all-or-nothing principle. To do so, separate data
snapshot is automatically maintained for each transaction.
That is a logical snapshot that does not create a full copy
of all the data.

Compensating rollback operations are not needed in case of the
transaction failure, because all the changes made by the transaction
in its logical snapshot are simply discarded. In case the transaction
is successfully applied, affected caches are marked as obsolete
and corresponding caching functions are re-executed in a proper
order (but only when all the data changes are fully applied).

Asynchronous operations (promises) are supported out of the box
during transaction execution. The transaction may consist of a set of
asynchronous calls prolonging the transaction until completion of
all of them. An asynchronous call may spawn other asynchronous
calls, which prolong transaction execution until the whole chain
of asynchronous operations is fully completed.

## Reaction & Cache

Reaction is an code block that is immediately called in response to
changes made by a transaction in observable objects. Cache is a
computed value having an associated function that is called
on-demand to renew the value if it was marked as obsolete due to changes
made by a transaction. Reactive and cached functions are
instrumented with hooks to seamlessly subscribe to those
observable objects and other cached functions (dependencies),
which are used during their execution.

``` tsx
class MyView extends Component<{model: MyModel}> {
  @cached
  render(): JSX.Element {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.props.model.url}</h1>
        <div>{this.props.model.content}</div>
      </div>
    )
  } // render is subscribed to "url" and "content"
}
```

``` tsx
class Component<P> extends React.Component<P> {
  @cached
  render(): JSX.Element {
    throw new Error('render method is undefined')
  }

  @reaction // called immediately in response to changes
  ensureUpToDate(): void {
    if (this.shouldComponentUpdate())
      standalone(() => this.setState({})) // ask React to re-render
  } // ensureUpToDate is subscribed to render

  shouldComponentUpdate(): boolean {
    return !Reactronic.getController(this.render).isUpToDate
  }

  componentDidMount(): void {
    this.ensureUpToDate() // run to subscribe for the first time
  }

  componentWillUnmount(): void {
    standalone(Reactronic.dispose, this)
  }
}
```

In the example above, reactive function `refresh` is transparently subscribed
to the cached function `render`. In turn, the `render` function is
subscribed to the `url` and `content` properties of a corresponding
`MyModel` object. Once `url` or `content` values are changed, the
`render` cache becomes obsolete and causes the `refresh` reaction to become
obsolete as well and re-executed. While being executed, the `refresh`
function enqueues re-rendering request to React, which calls
`render` function causing it to renew its cached value.

In general case, all reactions and caches are automatically and
immediately marked as obsolete when changes are made in those observable
objects and cached functions that were used during their execution.
And once marked, the functions are automatically executed again,
either immediately (for @reactive functions) or on-demand
(for @cached functions).

Reactronic takes full care of tracking dependencies between
all the observable objects and reactions/caches (observables and observers).
With Reactronic, you no longer need to create data change events
in one set of objects, subscribe to these events in other objects,
and manually maintain switching from the previous object version
to a new one.

## Behavior Options

There are multiple options to configure behavior of transactional reactivity.

**Order** options defines order of reactions execution:

  - (TBD)

**Throttling** option defines how often reaction is executed in case of recurring changes:

  - `(ms)` - minimal delay in milliseconds between reaction execution;
  - `-1` - execute reaction immediately once transaction is applied (synchronously);
  - `0` - execute reaction immediately via event loop (asynchronously with zero timeout);
  - `>= Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` - never execute reaction (disabled reaction).

**Reentrance** option defines how to handle reentrant calls of transactions and reactions:

  - `PreventWithError` - fail with error if there is an existing call in progress;
  - `WaitAndRestart` - wait for previous call to finish and then restart current one;
  - `CancelPrevious` - cancel previous call in favor of recent one;
  - `CancelAndWaitPrevious` - cancel previous call in favor of recent one (but wait until canceling is completed)
  - `RunSideBySide` - multiple simultaneous calls are allowed.

**Monitor** is an object that maintains the status of running functions,
which it is attached to. A single monitor object can be shared between
multiple transactions, reactions, and cache functions, thus maintaining
consolidated status for all of them (busy, workers, etc).

## Notes

Inspired by: MobX, Nezaboodka, Excel.

Key Reactronic principles and differentiators:

  - No compromises on consistency, clarity, and simplicity;
  - Minimalism and zero boilerplating (it's not a framework bloating your code);
  - Asynchrony, patches, undo/redo, conflict resolving are provided out of the box;
  - Seamless integration with transactionally-reactive object-oriented databases like [Nezaboodka](https://nezaboodka.com/#products);
  - Compact dependency-free implementation consisting of less than 2K lines of code.

Roadmap:

  - Patches and conflict resolution API (partially done)
  - History/undo/redo API and implementation (partially done)
  - Sync API and implementation (not implemented yet)
