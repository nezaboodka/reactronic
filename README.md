# **Reactronic** - Transactional Reactive State Management

Reactronic is an experimental JavaScript library that provides
[transactional reactive](https://blog.nezaboodka.com/post/2019/593-modern-database-should-natively-support-transactionally-reactive-programming)
state management in a Web application.

Transactional reactivity means that state changes are being made in an
isolated data snapshot and then, once atomically applied, are
**consistently propagated** to corresponding visual components for
(re)rendering. All that is done in automatic, seamless, and fine-grained
way. Reactronic **takes full care of tracking dependencies**
between visual components (observers) and state (observable objects).

Transactional reactivity is based on four fundamental concepts:

  - **Observable Objects** - a set of objects that store data of an
    application (state);
  - **Impact Function** - it makes changes in observable
    objects in atomic way ("all or nothing");
  - **Reaction Function** - it is executed automatically in
    response to changes made by a transaction;
  - **Cache Function** - its result is remembered and, if the becomes
  obsolete, recomputed on-demand.

Demo application built with Reactronic: https://nevod.io/#/playground.
Source code of the demo: https://gitlab.com/nezaboodka/nevod.web.public/-/blob/master/README.md.

Quick introduction and detailed description is below.

## Quick Introduction

Here is an example of transactional reactive code:

``` typescript
class Demo extends ObservableObject {
  name: string = 'Nezaboodka Software'
  email: string = 'contact@nezaboodka.com'

  @impact
  saveContact(name: string, email: string): void {
    this.name = name
    this.email = email
  }

  @reaction
  printContact(): void {
    // depends on `name` and `email` and reacts to their changes
    if (this.email.indexOf('@') >= 0)
      throw new Error(`wrong email ${this.email}`)
    console.log(this.name + ' <' + this.email + '>')
  }
}
```

In the example above, `Demo` is an observable object,
meaning that access to its fields are seamlessly tracked
to determine dependent reactions and caches. Reaction
function `printContact` reads `name` and `email` fields
and depends on them. Reaction function is executed
automatically in response to changes of these fields
made by `saveContact` impact function.

Here is an example of a cached value (re-)computed on-demand:

``` typescript
class Demo extends ObservableObject {
  name: string = 'Nezaboodka Software'
  email: string = 'contact@nezaboodka.com'

  @cache
  get contact(): string {
    return this.name + ' <' + this.email + '>'
  }

  @reaction
  printContact(): void {
    if (this.contact !== '')
      Console.log(this.contact)
  }
}
```

In the example above, the value of `contact` is computed from
source fields `name` and `email` upon first use. Once computed,
the result is cached and is reused until source fields `name`
and `email` are changed. Once source fields changed, `contact`
value becomes obsolete, thus causing execution of depending
reaction function `printContact`. When `printContact` function
runs it reads `contact` and causes its re-computation.

## Observable Objects

Observable objects store data of an application. All such objects
are transparently hooked to track access to their properties,
both on reads and writes.

``` typescript
class MyModel extends ObservableObject {
  url: string = "https://github.com/nezaboodka/reactronic"
  content: string = "transactional reactive state management"
  timestamp: Date = Date.now()
}
```

In the example above, the class `MyModel` is based on Reactronic's
`ObservableObject` class and all its properties `url`, `content`,
and `timestamp` are hooked.

## Impact

Impact function makes changes in observable objects
in transactional (atomic) way, thus provoking execution
of dependent reactions and recalculation of dependent
caches. Impact function is instrumented with hooks to
provide transparent atomicity (by implicit context
switching and isolation).

``` typescript
class MyModel extends ObservableObject {
  // ...
  @impact
  async load(url: string): Promise<void> {
    this.url = url
    this.content = await fetch(url)
    this.timestamp = Date.now()
  }
}
```

In the example above, the impact function `load` makes
changes to `url`, `content` and `timestamp` properties. While
impact transaction is running, the changes are visible only inside the
transaction itself. The new values become atomically visible outside
of the transaction only upon its completion.

Atomicity is achieved by making changes in an isolated data
snapshot that is not visible outside of the running transaction
until it is fully finished and applied. Multiple objects
and their properties can be changed with full respect
to the all-or-nothing principle. To do so, separate data
snapshot is automatically maintained for each transaction.
That is a logical snapshot that does not create a full copy
of all the data.

Compensating rollback operations are not needed in case of the
transaction failure, because all the changes made by the transaction
in its logical snapshot are simply discarded. In case the transaction
is successfully applied, affected caches are marked as obsolete
and corresponding caching functions are re-executed in a proper
order (but only when all the data changes are fully applied).

Asynchronous operations (promises) are supported out of the box
during transaction execution. The transaction may consist of a set of
asynchronous calls prolonging the transaction until completion of
all of them. An asynchronous call may spawn other asynchronous
calls, which prolong transaction execution until the whole chain
of asynchronous operations is fully completed.

## Reaction & Cache

Reaction function is automatically and immediately called in
response to changes in observable objects made by an impact function.
Cache function is called on-demand to renew the value if it was
marked as obsolete due to changes made by an impact function.
Reaction and cache functions are instrumented with hooks
to seamlessly subscribe to those observable objects and
other cache functions (dependencies), which are used
during their execution.

``` tsx
class MyView extends Component<{model: MyModel}> {
  @cache
  render(): JSX.Element {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.props.model.url}</h1>
        <div>{this.props.model.content}</div>
      </div>
    )
  } // render is subscribed to "url" and "content"
}
```

``` tsx
class Component<P> extends React.Component<P> {
  @cache
  render(): JSX.Element {
    throw new Error('render method is undefined')
  }

  @reaction // called immediately in response to changes
  ensureUpToDate(): void {
    if (this.shouldComponentUpdate())
      Transaction.outside(() => this.setState({})) // ask React to re-render
  } // ensureUpToDate is subscribed to render

  shouldComponentUpdate(): boolean {
    return !RxSystem.getController(this.render).isUpToDate
  }

  componentDidMount(): void {
    this.ensureUpToDate() // run to subscribe for the first time
  }

  componentWillUnmount(): void {
    Transaction.run(null, RxSystem.dispose, this)
  }
}
```

In the example above, reaction function `refresh` is transparently subscribed
to the cache function `render`. In turn, the `render` cache function is
subscribed to the `url` and `content` properties of a corresponding
`MyModel` object. Once `url` or `content` values are changed, the
`render` cache becomes obsolete and causes the `refresh` function to become
obsolete as well and re-executed. While being executed, the `refresh`
function enqueues re-rendering request to React, which calls
`render` function causing it to renew its cached value.

In general case, all reactions and caches are automatically and
immediately marked as obsolete when changes are made in those observable
objects and other cached functions that were used during their execution.
And once marked, the functions are automatically executed again,
either immediately (for @reaction functions) or on-demand
(for @cached functions).

Reactronic takes full care of tracking dependencies between
all the observable objects and reaction/caches.
With Reactronic, you no longer need to create data change events
in one set of objects, subscribe to these events in other objects,
and manually maintain switching from the previous object version
to a new one.

## Behavior Options

There are multiple options to configure behavior of transactional reactivity.

**Order** options defines order of execution for reactions:

  - (TBD)

**Throttling** option defines how often reaction is executed in case
of recurring changes:

  - `(ms)` - minimal delay in milliseconds between executions;
  - `-1` - execute immediately once transaction is applied (synchronously);
  - `0` - execute immediately via event loop (asynchronously with zero timeout);
  - `>= Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` - never execute (suspended reaction).

**Reentrance** option defines how to handle reentrant calls of impact
and reaction functions:

  - `preventWithError` - fail with error if there is an existing call in progress;
  - `waitAndRestart` - wait for previous call to finish and then restart current one;
  - `cancelPrevious` - cancel previous call in favor of recent one;
  - `cancelAndWaitPrevious` - cancel previous call in favor of recent one (but wait until canceling is completed)
  - `runSideBySide` - multiple simultaneous calls are allowed.

**Indicator** is an object that maintains status of running functions,
which it is attached to. A single indicator object can be shared between
multiple transactional, reactive, and cached functions, thus maintaining
consolidated status for all of them (busy, workers, etc).

## Notes

Inspired by: MobX, Nezaboodka, Excel.

Key Reactronic principles and differentiators:

  - No compromises on consistency, clarity, and simplicity;
  - Minimalism and zero boilerplating (it's not a framework bloating your code);
  - Asynchrony, patches, undo/redo, conflict resolving are provided out of the box;
  - Seamless integration with transactional reactive object-oriented databases like [Nezaboodka](https://nezaboodka.com/#products);
  - Compact dependency-free implementation consisting of less than 2K lines of code.

Roadmap:

  - Patches and conflict resolution API (partially done)
  - History/undo/redo API and implementation (partially done)
  - Sync API and implementation (not implemented yet)
